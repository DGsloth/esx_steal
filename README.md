- [mythic_resources](https://github.com/TheWardenEternal/mythic_resources/archive/main.zip)

### Features
- Proper robbing system that isn't broken (or like the standard robbing script where you have to aim and release E at the same time to work)
- Victim needs their hands up
- Robber needs to type in `/steal`

### Information
If the `hands up` portion of the script does not work, seperate it into it's own file  
I will not provide any kind of support for this addon. If someone makes a pull request to fix something, I may merge it.
